              The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The novel virus was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019; a lockdown in Wuhan and other cities in surrounding Hubei failed to contain the outbreak, and it quickly spread to other parts of mainland China and around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Multiple variants of the virus have emerged and become dominant in many countries since 2021, with the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants being the most virulent. As of 15 October 2021, more than 239 million cases and 4.88 million deaths have been confirmed, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.

              COVID-19 symptoms range from none to life-threatening. Severe illness is more likely in elderly patients and those with certain underlying medical conditions. Transmission of COVID-19 occurs when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but the virus can transmit over longer distances, particularly indoors and in poorly ventilated areas. Transmission can also occur, rarely, via contaminated surfaces or fluids. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms.

              Several vaccines have been approved and distributed in various countries, which have initiated mass vaccination campaigns since December 2020. Other recommended preventive measures include social distancing, wearing face masks in public, ventilation and air-filtering, covering one's mouth when sneezing or coughing, hand washing, disinfecting surfaces, and quarantining people who have been exposed or are symptomatic. Treatments focus on addressing symptoms, but work is underway to develop medications that inhibit the virus. Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, business closures, workplace hazard controls, testing protocols, and systems for tracing contacts of the infected.

              The pandemic has resulted in severe social and economic disruption around the world, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s.[8] It has led to widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying, agricultural disruption, food shortages, and decreased emissions of pollutants. Numerous educational institutions and public areas have been partially or fully closed, and many events have been cancelled or postponed. Misinformation has circulated through social media and mass media, and political tensions have been exacerbated. The pandemic has raised issues of racial and geographic discrimination, health equity, and the balance between public health imperatives and individual rights.
              <p style="text-align: center;"><br><b>Naming</b><br></p>
              The pandemic is known by several names. It is often referred to as its colloquial name, "the coronavirus pandemic",[9] despite the existence of other human coronaviruses that have caused epidemics and outbreaks (e.g. SARS).[10] Before it was declared a pandemic, it was known as "the coronavirus outbreak" and "Wuhan coronavirus outbreak".[11]
              
              During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus",[12] with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia".[13][14] In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV[15] and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease[16] as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma.[17] The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020.[18] Tedros Adhanom explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019).[19] The WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.[18]
              
              The variants of the virus are also known by several names. Before being given official names by the WHO, they were commonly named after where the variants were found (e.g. Delta variant was known as the Indian variant),[20] and are also known colloquially as "variants of concern".[21][22] At the end of May 2021, the WHO assigned labels to all the variants after introducing a new policy of using Greek letters for variants of concern and variants of interest.[23]
              <p style="text-align: center;"><br><b>Death Record</b><br></p>
              Official deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols. These counts may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.[67] Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to over-counting.[68] Comparisons of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicate excess mortality in many countries.[69][70] This may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.[71] The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.[72] Nevertheless, the first reported death outside of China occurred on 1 February 2020 in the Philippines,[73] and the first reported death outside Asia was in the United States on 6 February 2020.[74]

              More than 95 per cent of the people who contract COVID-19 recover. Otherwise, the time between symptoms onset and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.[75] As of 15 October 2021, more than 4.88 million[4] deaths have been attributed to COVID-19. People at the greatest risk of mortality from COVID-19 tend to be those with underlying conditions, such as those with a weakened immune system, serious heart or lung problems, severe obesity, or the elderly (including individuals age 65 years or older).[76][77] The strongest risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness are obesity, complications of diabetes, and anxiety disorders.[78]

              Multiple measures are used to quantify mortality.[79] These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response,[80] time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.[81] Countries like Belgium include deaths from suspected cases of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases.[82]

              The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 2.04 percent (4,886,917 deaths for 239,926,774 cases) as of 15 October 2021.[4] The number varies by region.[83]
